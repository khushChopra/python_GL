##Computer Graphics Project Report: Obstacle Avoiding Game

The project is a game having obstacles coming towards the screen and the user have to use arrow keys to avoid and increase their score. This game is coded in Python and uses PyOpenGL libraries. The development of this project is to showcase techniques of computer graphics like texture mapping, 3D objects, translation and rotation of 3D objects, polygon filling, perspective viewing, hidden surface removal. The game is infinite and uses optimisation techniques to use minimum space as possible.
